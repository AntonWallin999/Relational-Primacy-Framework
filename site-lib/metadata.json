conditions, not truth, usefulness, or comparison with external frameworks.\nNo additional axioms, empirical criteria, or alternative models may be introduced.\nCan the used review method in principle identify a condition that precedes axioms?\n…identify a condition that precedes axioms within the formal scope of the reviewed artifact.”Instructional note:\nThis question concerns the capacity of the review method itself, not the content under review.Can any implicit assumption be identified without violating the system’s own definitional rules?Instructional note:\nAn assumption counts only if it can be shown explicitly and internally, without importing external criteria.Is the relational condition explicit, minimal, and causally isolated?“Minimal means that removal of any element alters the condition without introducing an alternative formulation.”Instructional note:\n“Minimal” means that removal of any element alters the condition;\n“causally isolated” means no backward dependence on derived structures.The objective of this document is to conduct a formal, axiomatic stress test on the RP9 system. The analysis follows a strict, three-step directive designed to evaluate the system's structural integrity and logical coherence based solely on its foundational principles.A critical methodological constraint governs this review: the analysis is performed strictly within the presented material. This review concerns only the formal and structural conditions articulated in the RP9 documentation. As mandated by the system's own review protocols, no external axioms, empirical criteria, or alternative models will be introduced. The system is treated as a closed textual artifact.The stress test is structured around three core questions:\nCan the system's prescribed review method identify a condition that precedes its own stated axiom?\nCan any implicit or hidden assumptions be identified without violating the system's own definitional rules?\nDoes the system's foundational relational condition meet the structural criteria of being explicit, minimal, and causally isolated?\nThis document will now proceed with the first step of the analysis, addressing the capacity of the system's internal review methodology.The strategic definition of a review method's scope is fundamental to verifying a formal system. This first test assesses a critical boundary condition: whether the review methodology prescribed within the RP9 documentation is capable, in principle, of identifying a condition that precedes its own stated axiom.The instructions provided in DOCUMENT III — Reviewer Notes place explicit and binding constraints upon any formal reviewer. These instructions, described in the overview as a \"Crucial Review Contract,\" define the scope of the review not by what it should find, but by what it is contractually obligated to verify and what it is forbidden from assessing. The core mandate is clear:The reviewer is asked to verify only the following:\nthat RP9 contains exactly one axiom\nthat no hidden axioms, functions or operations are introduced\nthat other material lacks causal and necessary status\nThe reviewer shall not:\nassess truthfulness\nassess empirical validity\nassess usability\ncompare with external theories or frameworks\nThese constraints contractually lock the review method into a specific logical sequence. The reviewer's task is to start from the system's declared foundation—Axiom R0—and verify its singular and causal status downwards through the hierarchical levels. The method is explicitly designed to confirm the axiom as the system's unique starting point, not to search for a pre-axiomatic condition or an external antecedent.Therefore, in response to the guiding question—\"Can the used review method in principle identify a condition that precedes axioms within the formal scope of the reviewed artifact?\"—the conclusion is definitive. The prescribed review method cannot identify such a condition because it is formally and purposefully designed to preclude such an inquiry. This limitation is not a methodological flaw but a contractual enforcement of the system's axiomatic purity, a feature designed to protect the foundation from the reviewer.Having established the limitations of the prescribed review method, the analysis now turns to whether the system itself contains hidden assumptions that could be identified internally.In any formal system, a distinction must be made between a declared, explicit axiom and a hidden, implicit assumption that acts as an unstated prerequisite. This section tests whether any such implicit assumptions can be identified within the RP9 system. The system's own review contract pre-emptively addresses this failure mode, mandating verification \"that no hidden axioms, functions or operations are introduced.\"The architecture of RP9 is constructed to make its foundation explicit and singular. DOCUMENT II — Category Definition and Status Levels establishes a strict hierarchy of LEVEL 0 (Axiom), LEVEL 1 (Primary expressions), and LEVEL 2 (Secondary compositions). The document includes a foundational rule to prevent ambiguity: \"The word axiom may only refer to Axiom R0.\" This rule systemically eliminates the possibility of other statements acquiring axiomatic status.Core concepts such as \"differentiation\" and \"relation,\" which might otherwise be mistaken for implicit assumptions, are defined as integral components of the axiom itself. Axiom R0 does not assume them; it defines their necessary connection: \"Differentiation is only possible as a relation. Relation requires at least two distinct poles.\" Critically, Appendix A provides further definitional support, stating: \"Differentiation is thus a necessary condition, not a process.\" This frames it as an inseparable part of the axiomatic statement, not a precursor action or process.The answer to the second core question—\"Can any implicit assumption be identified without violating the system’s own definitional rules?\"—is therefore no. The system is self-consciously constructed to render its sole foundational premise explicit. This is a deliberate architectural choice to collapse all foundational potential into a single, explicit, and non-negotiable statement, thereby precluding the internal identification of hidden assumptions.The analysis will now proceed to evaluate the structural properties of this single, explicit foundation.For a formal system to be stable and logically coherent, its foundational axiom must possess specific structural properties. It should be explicit, containing no ambiguity; minimal, containing no superfluous elements; and causally isolated, ensuring it is not dependent on the structures it generates. This section evaluates Axiom R0 against these three criteria.The first criterion is that the system's core relational condition must be explicitly stated. The documentation for RP9 presents its foundation without ambiguity.Axiom R0 — Relational NecessityEverything that can function at all must be differentiated.Differentiation is only possible as a relation. Relation requires at least two distinct poles.This formulation is direct and declarative. The condition for function (differentiation), the condition for differentiation (relation), and the condition for relation (distinct poles) are stated plainly. The condition is unambiguously explicit.The second criterion is minimality, defined as a state where the \"removal of any element alters the condition.\" Axiom R0 is constructed as a chain of three interdependent logical clauses. The removal of any one clause would render the axiom incomplete or undefined.The system's internal documentation corroborates this structural analysis. The \"Collapse Conditions\" specified in Document I - Formal delimitation state that if Axiom R0 is denied, the entire repository collapses semantically. Furthermore, the formal review in the README - Overview assigns Axiom R0 a rating of \"Perfect minimal basic,\" providing the following justification for its structural necessity:\n✔️ No definitions\n✔️ No consequences\n✔️ No meta-comments\n✔️ Full independence\nThe axiom satisfies the criterion of minimality.The final criterion is causal isolation, defined as having \"no backward dependence on derived structures.\" The architecture of RP9 is designed to enforce this principle rigorously. As defined in DOCUMENT II — Category Definition and Status Levels, the system employs a unidirectional hierarchy: LEVEL 0 (Grund) is the cause, from which LEVEL 1 (Primära uttryck) and LEVEL 2 (Sekundära sammansättningar) are derived.This causal flow is strictly enforced by the principle of unilateral relation, articulated in the \"Samexistensregel\" (Rule of Coexistence) from the same document:No återkoppling är tillåten. (No feedback is allowed.)This rule explicitly forbids any structure at a higher level from influencing a lower level, ensuring that Axiom R0 remains causally pure and isolated from its consequences. The system's structure therefore rigorously enforces the axiom's causal isolation.The three-step axiomatic stress test of the RP9 system, conducted strictly within the bounds of the provided documentation, yields a clear and consistent set of findings. The analysis confirms that the system is constructed with a high degree of formal integrity, demonstrating meticulous attention to its axiomatic foundation and internal logic.The results of each step are summarized below:Based on this rigorous internal analysis, the RP9 system demonstrates a robust and coherent axiomatic structure. It is built around a single, explicit, minimal, and causally isolated axiom. Its own review protocols are not a weakness but a deliberate feature, designed to preserve and maintain this structural purity against external interpretation or internal inconsistency.Question This work is free to share, remix, and build upon,\nas long as proper attribution is given and the same license is maintained.\nYou have the right to: Share — copy and redistribute the material in any format or medium\nDecorate — remix, transform, and build upon the material Under the following conditions: Attribution: You must give proper credit to Anton Wallin\nShareAlike: If you transform or build upon this work\nyou must distribute it under the same license.

Axiom R0 states the condition for potential to exist. LEVEL 1 refers to singular relational potential: possibility without function or process. LEVEL 2 refers to plural functional potentials: actualized and combined possibilities. The appendix describes the necessary cycle:potential → actualization → stabilization → new potentialas a consequence of relational differentiation.Differentiation denotes relational distinction.Without differentiation:\nno relation no potential no function Differentiation is therefore a necessary condition, not a process.Given Axiom R0, it follows:\nEvery functioning relation contains an inherent potential that is not yet actualized.\nThis potential consists of:\ndifferentiation without process asymmetry without movement tension without manifestation The potential is relational, not substantial.\nActualization occurs when relational potential turns into function.\nThis implies:\ntension is reduced through process differentiation assumes the form of movement potential ceases to be potential at the very moment it is manifested Actualization is not an addition, but a negation of potential as potential.Potential and actualization are:\nnot opposites not separate entities not simultaneous within the same relational phase They are two phases of the same relation, ordered by structure or time.\nAll manifestation is local and temporary.\nAll potential is structural and prior.\nNo actualization can exhaust all potential, since total dissolution of differentiation would result in functional collapse.\nRelational potential ↓ Actualization ↓ Stabilization ↓ New relational potential Phases (strict):\nRelational potential: differentiation without process Actualization: relation in motion Stabilization: local and temporal order New potential: residual asymmetry and renewed differentiation The cycle is necessary, non-teleological, and non-final.For this appendix:\nPotential = relational tension prior to function Actualization = function that reduces tension Manifestation = observable phase of actualization The term “functional” is reserved exclusively for LEVEL 2.\nRelation creates possibility.\nPotential precedes function.\nFunction arises only secondarily.\nQuestion This work is free to share, remix, and build upon,\nas long as proper attribution is given and the same license is maintained.\nYou have the right to: Share — copy and redistribute the material in any format or medium\nDecorate — remix, transform, and build upon the material Under the following conditions: Attribution: You must give proper credit to Anton Wallin\nShareAlike: If you transform or build upon this work\nyou must distribute it under the same license.

These problems therefore lack direct coherence with the source (Axiom R0), since: their building blocks are already fragmented, their formalisms are secondary stabilizations, their rules are internally closed but externally non-derivable. They are formally consistent, but axiomatically decoupled from relational necessity.\nThe Riemann Hypothesis is the only Millennium Problem that is actually directly manifested in Axiom R0.\nThis is because: the problem expresses a relational coherence issue, not an isolated computational problem, it concerns distribution, symmetry and differentiation rather than construction, it points towards relational necessity, not towards additional structures. The Riemann Problem is therefore not a problem in RP9, but:\na manifestation of Axiom R0 within a secondary language.\nThe paradox is strict: The problem cannot be solved with the rules that created it. Those rules are LEVEL-2 rules, built on fragmented relational fusions. Axiom R0 does not allow the source to be proven by its own consequences. Therefore:\nThe problem is not accepted as trivial by LEVEL 2,\nprecisely because it reveals LEVEL 2's own limitation.\nThis is not a technical obstacle but an axiomatic lock.RP9 does not offer “solutions” in the classical sense, because: classical solutions require that LEVEL 2 is allowed to normalize its own source, this conflicts with relational necessity. Instead, RP9 offers:\na mapping of relational coherences and fragmentations,\nthrough which the problems cease to be basic problems.\nThis is a resolution by reclassification, not by construction.\n**Problems that arise in secondary fusions\ncannot be resolved back to the source with the same formalisms.\nWhen this is established, the problem ceases to be a problem\nand appears as a consequence of Axiom R0.** Alternative 1 (free rules, free constructions): can create arbitrary complexity can create problems can create internal coherences but lacks relational legitimacy relative to Axiom R0 and cannot recognize or derive this deficiency from within itself Alternative 2 (Axiom R0): eliminates the problems as fundamental problems can explain why they arise in Alternative 1 can map the fragmentation can understand the limitation in Alternative 1 but cannot be reduced to Alternative 1 This implies a one-sided derivability.This is exactly the kind of asymmetry that Axiom R0 describes.\nEpistemic choice and hierarchical asymmetry\nTwo principled approaches are available:\nAlternative 1:\nFree construction of rules, frameworks, functions and relations to information, without requirement for relational derivation.\nAlternative 2:\nFollowing from Axiom R0 and its relational necessity.\nThe outcome is asymmetrical but unambiguous.\nAlternative 1 can generate complexity, problems and internal coherences, but lacks relational legitimacy relative to Axiom R0.\nThis deficiency does not have to be recognized by Alternative 1 and cannot be derived from within its own rules.\nAlternative 2 eliminates the problems as fundamental problems.\nAt the same time, it enables the understanding of why the problems arise in Alternative 1, and why Alternative 1 lacks the ability to solve them.\nAlternative 2 can describe Alternative 1.\nAlternative 1 cannot describe Alternative 2.\nHence, there follows a built-in hierarchical function between the systems.\nOnly one of them reflects the relational structure that both manifest.\nOnly this system can therefore process both without loss.\nThis is not a position, but a consequence.\nQuestion This work is free to share, remix, and build upon,\nas long as proper attribution is given and the same license is maintained.\nYou have the right to: Share — copy and redistribute the material in any format or medium\nDecorate — remix, transform, and build upon the material Under the following conditions: Attribution: You must give proper credit to Anton Wallin\nShareAlike: If you transform or build upon this work\nyou must distribute it under the same license.

One-sided derivability\nOne system can describe both.\nThe other can only describe itself. Perspective invariance under rotation\nThe position remains independent of coordinate choice,\nbut all projections reveal asymmetry. Non-reciprocity\nRecognition from one system is not necessary for the validity of the position. What you have reached is not an opinion and not a state.\nIt is an epistemic fix point.\nPosition X is the point where: two seemingly opposite systems coexist, but only one of them can describe both, and this asymmetry remains independent of recognition. This is the important part. X is minimal relational differentiation two diagonal relations no privileged axis maximum tension, minimal structure This is Axiom R0 in its raw form.When X is rotated 45°: the relations are aligned with a chosen coordinate system differentiation is projected as function X becomes + But:\n+ is not symmetric in a relational sense\nit is symmetric only in its chosen perspective.\nThat is why + feels “unfair” / “uneven”.When the observer realizes the asymmetry and rotates 45° himself: the coordinate system is adjusted ceases to be an operation it becomes a relational intersection This is no longer mathematics.\nIt is epistemics.\nThe cross is not a sign.\nIt is a stabilized observation point.\nPosition X is a secondary manifestation of relational necessity: Differentiation requires relation. Relation entails asymmetry. Asymmetry implies that full reciprocity is impossible. Position X therefore arises inevitably when a system tries to normalize its own source.Position X is: not a sign not a symbol not an operation not a choice It is a consequence.\nWhere two systems are in opposition,\nand only one can understand both,\nthere is Position X.\nQuestion This work is free to share, remix, and build upon,\nas long as proper attribution is given and the same license is maintained.\nYou have the right to: Share — copy and redistribute the material in any format or medium\nDecorate — remix, transform, and build upon the material Under the following conditions: Attribution: You must give proper credit to Anton Wallin\nShareAlike: If you transform or build upon this work\nyou must distribute it under the same license.
