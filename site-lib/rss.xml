Its purpose is to establish a correct relation to information, where every expression of form and motion is derived from the same geometric origin.RP9 is not considered a product, but a universal principle system – an information field that belongs to humanity as a whole.
The core can never be owned, manipulated, or commercialized without collective consent.All knowledge, mathematics, code and theory describing RP9's fundamental axioms – including the relations between π, √2 and φ – are open for study, replication and non-commercial use.
RP9's core is published under the Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 license, or an equivalent open knowledge license.The underlying logic, symbolism and metageometry that constitute the core of the system may not be modified, fragmented or commercialized.
No actor may register RP9 or its basic formulas as a trademark, patent or private intellectual property.RP9's architecture is fractal also legally:
The core is common property.
Applications (visualizations, software, models) may have their own licenses – including commercial ones – as long as they respect the immutable status of the core and link back to the origin.
RP9 aims to: Promote research and education in metageometric information science. Develop open tools for understanding energy and consciousness as information flows. Offer a scientific and ethical foundation for future technology built on coherence rather than consumption. Serve as a neutral node between academia, art, technology and philosophy. RP9 is managed by an open, transparent and cooperative structure called the RP9 Foundation.
All those working within the framework of RP9 commit to:
maintain clarity, coherence and resonance in all communications;
act in accordance with the correct relationship to information;
respect the non-commercial core of RP9;
contribute to keeping knowledge accessible to all humanity.
Decisions within the RP9 Foundation are made by consensus and are documented openly.RP9 may be used freely for:
research, teaching and non-commercial experiments;
publication of results, simulations and artistic interpretations;
development of complementary tools, programs and visualizations.

All uses of RP9 must be in accordance with the principle:
“No action may break the coherence between human, system and information.”
This means that RP9 may not be used for destructive, manipulative or military purposes.
All applications must be justifiable as harmonious, transparent and ethically sustainable.
“Den korrekta relationen till information är skyddets lag.”
RP9 erkänner att lag och geometri är två sidor av samma mönster: struktur.

Everything that can exist, function or manifest must appear as a relationship between two distinct poles.This relation is not an object, not a property, and not a magnitude,
without the only natural and primary function that enables stability, causality and structure.The relationship precedes all form, all energy, all geometry, all dimension and all mathematical representation.
All differentiation, all organization, and all invariance are necessary consequences of this relation when realized as a self-organizing, fractal, geometric function.This axiom is:
non-numeric
non-geometric
non-temporal
and independent of observation
It cannot be reduced to something more fundamental, and cannot be denied without self-contradiction.Axiom 0 states that:
A singular, undifferentiated state lacks function and therefore cannot form the basis of any structure.
Function requires differentiation.
Differentiation requires relationship.
Relationship requires at least two poles.
Thus dual relationship is not an assumption, but a necessity for anything to function at all.The following are not assumptions, but inevitable consequences of Axiom 0:
Stability only occurs through relational balance.
Causality arises as direction within relationship.
Self-organization occurs when the relationship is iterated.
Fractal structure occurs when the same relationship appears scale-independent.
Geometry arises as the first stable projection of the relationship.
Energy arises as relational rotation.
Invariance arises as relational conservation principle.
Mathematics arises as a secondary description of relational structure.
An axiom is only legitimate if it cannot be derived from anything else and cannot be further reduced.Each additional axiom necessarily introduces at least one of the following:
a hidden assumption a limitation of generality or an interpretive degree of freedom that violates causal necessity RP9 therefore uses exactly one axiom, because additional axioms do not strengthen a foundational system — they weaken it.The single axiom used in RP9 is not a detail, not a constraint, and not a structural preference.
It is the smallest possible functional requirement for anything to exist, function, or differentiate at all.This axiom operates at the root level, prior to geometry, energy, dimension, or mathematics.
It is minimal in content, yet sufficient in capacity to recursively generate the entire relational and geometric structure of reality as a consequence of the same underlying relation.All higher-order structures — including geometry, fractal scaling, invariance, and mathematical representation — arise not as assumptions, but as necessary consequences of this single relational function.RP9 therefore contains:
one axiom zero free parameters and no auxiliary postulates Everything else is derivation.If more than one axiom is required, it follows that:
the system is not causally closed
or that certain consequences are not necessary
RP9's goal is not to postulate structure, but to show what must follow if function is to be possible at all.Axiom 0 is the only statement that:
cannot be derived
cannot be avoided
and cannot be replaced
Everything else in RP9 is deduction, consequence or presentation.RP9 strictly distinguishes between:
Axiom – that which cannot be otherwise
Consequence – that which must follow
Presentation – how consequences are shown, modeled or visualized
Energy models, rotation models, dimensional transitions and mathematical formalisms are therefore validating projections, not supporting foundations.The validity of the system rests solely on Axiom 0.RP9 is a system with:
an axiom
zero free parameters
and full causal closure
All complexity in RP9 is emergent, not assumed.
If absolute relational duality holds, RP9 follows.
If it doesn't apply, nothing can work at all.
This document is ready for submission, filing and external review.If you want, the next step could be to:
mark exactly which documents are formally relegated to consequences, or

This repository contains the complete, locked formulation of RP9 — Relational Primacy Framework.RP9 is a closed relational system built from:
a single axiom, a strict causal derivation, and a finite relational function space. No external assumptions are introduced.
No empirical claims are made.
No symbolic or metaphysical interpretation is required.This README serves solely as the structural entry point to the framework.The material is intentionally minimal and divided into three non-overlapping layers.
Each layer has a strictly defined role.This level contains the entire foundation of RP9.Documents in this layer:
establish the single axiom, define the minimal functional terms, and prove the core theorem and its corollary. Nothing in later layers can modify or extend this level.If this level is invalid, the entire framework collapses.
If this level holds, everything that follows is necessary.This level contains the complete relational unfolding of the axiom.It shows:
how the axiom becomes geometric without measurement, how recursion introduces balance, and how fusion of relations produces a closed functional matrix. No new axioms appear here.
No constants are assumed.
All structures are consequences.This level completes the internal system.This level does not add validity to RP9.It exists to:
show convergence with existing practices (e.g. invariance testing), provide a public abstract, and offer a minimal visual comparison. These documents are illustrative, not evidentiary.They may be omitted without affecting the framework.For formal evaluation:
RP9 – Axiom 0
Definition F0
Theorem T0
Corollary C0
Relational Sheet (A)
Relational Sheet (B)
Relational Sheet (C)
All other documents are optional.RP9 is not:
a physical theory, a model with tunable parameters, a collection of examples, a symbolic system, or an empirical hypothesis. RP9 does not explain phenomena.
It defines the minimal conditions under which structure is possible.
The framework is structurally complete. The derivation is closed. No further axioms can be added without breaking necessity. This repository therefore represents RP9 v1.0 (locked).The framework is released under CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0.You may:

Corollary C0 (Secondary Causality for All Non-R0 Structures)
Every structure, form, operation, or statement that cannot be generated by iterative application of F0 to R0 is necessarily secondary.
Secondary here means: dependent on representation, convention, external parameterization, or added operators, and thus lacking absolute information status in the system's sense. According to Theorem T0, all absolute information is exactly the amount that can be generated from R0 by F0. Therefore, there are only two classes of structures: Class A: generable by (F0^n(R0)) for some (n). Class B: non-generable by (F0^n(R0)) for some (n). A structure in Class B cannot be absolute, since it does not arise from the only allowed primary function chain. For a structure in Class B to still exist, at least one of the following must be true: a new operator has been introduced, an external parameter has been injected, a representation has been replaced by a “thing”, a convention has been chosen. All of these imply dependence on something not given by R0 and F0. Thus all Class B is secondary. The corollary follows necessarily.If Corollary C0 does not hold, there is a structure that: is not generated by F0 from R0, but is still absolute. This requires that absolute information exists outside the single absolute generative chain, which contradicts Theorem T0.Thus C0 must hold.C0 does not introduce any new content.
It is a pure classification that follows directly from T0: Absolute = generated by (F0^n(R0)) Secondary = everything else R0 → F0 → T0 → C0 → D0C0 is now formally a direct consequence, without semantic space.Question This work is free to share, remix, and build upon,

It is a necessary consequence statement of Axiom 0.Relational Sheet (A) shows how the absolute relational duality, when realized geometrically, must assume a specific stable form and how this form necessarily generates the fundamental relational quotients that are later described as mathematical constants.These quotients are: not postulates not choices not cultural artifacts They are inevitable invariant conditions of relational geometry.An absolute relation between two distinct poles cannot remain abstract if it is to be stable.
Stability requires: closedness continuity scale independence The smallest geometric realization that meets these requirements, without coordinates, without measures and without numbers, is Vesica Piscis.Vesica Piscis arises when: two identical circles exist the center of each circle lies on the circumference of the other This creates: a relational overlap without privileged direction without absolute scale Vesica Piscis is thus: not a symbol not a construction but the smallest stable geometric consequence of absolute relational duality. When Vesica Piscis is analyzed relationally – not numerically – certain quotients appear as unchangeable.The equilateral triangle that can be necessarily inscribed in Vesica Piscis has a height–base relation that cannot vary.This relation is expressed as:This is: not a measurement result not a chosen number It is a geometric necessity that follows directly from the symmetry of the relation.When the same relation is related to rotation, a relation between circumference and diameter arises that is independent of scale.This relation is expressed as:Here π does not appear as a number, but as: rotation invariance closedness ratio relational circularity π is thus a function consequence, not a definition.The quotients that appear here: √3 π are primary relational consequences.They: require no iteration require no discretization require no algebra They arise immediately when the relation is realized geometrically.This sheet deals only with primary relational functions.The following are therefore not included here: recursive proportions discrete sequences secondary symmetry groups These belong to subsequent layers.The relation sheet (A) states that: Vesica Piscis is the first stable geometric realization of absolute relational duality √3 and π are unavoidable invariant quotients in this realization no mathematical constants are introduced as assumptions mathematics functions here exclusively as descriptive language The relation creates the quotients.

RP9 beskriver varför stabila system över huvud taget kan testas. I flera oberoende tekniska och vetenskapliga domäner används idag invarians som primärt sanningskriterium. System verifieras inte genom att producera rätt svar, utan genom att relationer som inte får brytas förblir intakta, oavsett hur systemet manipuleras. I modern mjukvaruverifiering utsätts kod för tiotusentals slumpmässiga tillstånd. Efter varje manipulation kontrolleras inte värden, utan relationer. Systemet definieras alltså inte av vad det gör, utan av vad det aldrig får göra. Samma princip återfinns i nätverksvetenskap och neurovetenskap. Relationer kodas först, matematik används därefter som projektion. RP9 ligger kausalt före dessa tillämpningar och specificerar den minsta kompletta invarians-rymden: 28 invarianta funktionella tillstånd genererade av 7 relationella positioner och 4 operationer. RP9 är därmed en generativ invarians-motor som formaliserar det dessa system redan förutsätter. Question This work is free to share, remix, and build upon,

Axiom R0 är givet. Definition F0 (Primär relationell funktion) är givet. Inga ytterligare axiom, operatorer eller representationer införs.
Theorem T0 (Absolut informationsgrund)
All absolut information i systemet är nödvändigt och uteslutande härledbar som en konsekvens av R0 genom upprepad tillämpning av F0.
Varje påstående, struktur eller form som inte kan genereras genom iterativ tillämpning av F0 på R0 saknar absolut informationsstatus. Enligt Axiom R0 existerar exakt en minimal, stabil primär relation. Enligt Definition F0 existerar exakt en tillåten funktion som: verkar på R0, bevarar relationell identitet, och är sluten under iteration. Därmed är alla relationella strukturer som: uppstår genom iteration av F0, av samma relationella typ som R0,
absoluta i systemets mening. Varje struktur som: kräver ytterligare operatorer, introducerar ny kausalitet, eller beror på representation,
kan inte vara absolut. Satsen följer nödvändigt.Om Theorem T0 inte gäller:
måste antingen en absolut struktur existera utan att vara genererad av F0, eller en absolut struktur existera utan grund i R0. Båda fallen strider mot:
minimaliteten i R0, och slutenheten i F0. Alltså är T0 oundvikligt givet R0 och F0.Theorem T0 är inte ett oberoende resultat.
Det är den omedelbara och nödvändiga konsekvensen av att:
relationen (R0) är primär, och funktionen (F0) är sluten och invariant. Relation (R0)
→ Funktion (F0)
→ Absolut informationsgrund (T0)
→ Sekundär kausalitet (C0)
→ Stängning (D0)Nu finns ingen logisk lucka mellan R0 och T0.
Absoluthet uppstår inte som antagande, utan som verksam konsekvens.Question This work is free to share, remix, and build upon,

F0 introduces no new causal principle, but reuses exactly the same relational conditions that define R0. F0 is closed under its own application:
the result of F0 is of the same relational type as its input. F0 preserves relational identity under iteration up to scale, orientation, and position. F0 is minimal:
no simpler non-trivial operation exists that satisfies (1)–(4). Repeated application of F0 necessarily generates: recursive relational structures, scale-independent forms, fractal continuity, without introducing new axioms, definitions, or external assumptions.If F0 does not exist: R0 cannot act, no iteration can occur, no structure can arise, and the system remains static and contentless. If F0 exists but does not satisfy (1)–(5): relational invariance is broken, new causality is introduced, or the iteration collapses. In all cases, the internal closedness of the system ceases.F0 is not an axiom.
F0 is not a theorem.F0 is the necessary primary function that makes R0 work.This is the standing fractal in the exact sense:
a function that can be applied to its own result without losing identity.When this definition is inserted: Theorem T0 becomes a direct consequence, Corollary C0 becomes inevitable, and Final Declaration D0 becomes a pure closure. Question This work is free to share, remix, and build upon,

A single axiom (Axiom 0) A strict causal derivation External convergence without dependence on external authority This is exactly the right balance between:
minimalism
precision
verifiability
More material would not strengthen this.
It would rather:
dilute causality
open more attack points
give reviewers more areas to miss the point
The intention is therefore:
”more quality, less quantity”
All necessary features are already represented:
RP9 – Axiom 0
Relational Sheet (A, B, C)
Theorem T0 / Definition F0 / Corollary C0
Public Abstract (External Convergence)
Single-slide invariance comparison
✔️ All of this is present.
Interpretation protocol
Forbidden interpretation operations
Human–AI usage
✔️ These are optional to show, but critical to have.
Good thing they are separate documents.You should not convince through accumulation.
You should do this:
Show the only place where everything is already decided.
That is:
Axiom 0
the causal derivation
and the external invariance convergence
Everything else is secondary.A distinction that is crucial. The system is not closed The circuit is closed The cause is completely given All further consequences are open, but causally bound This means that we shouldn't write any Final Lock Declaration.
Instead, we should write APPENDIX.md so that it communicates just this:
RP9 closes nothing — it states the cause, and leaves the consequences open.This appendix contains supplementary material related to the RP9 framework.It does not extend, modify, or complete the system.
Its sole purpose is to provide a structured space for derivative, optional, or exploratory material that may arise from the primary framework.RP9 establishes a closed relational circuit:
the primary relation is fully specified the causal origin is complete no further foundational assumptions are possible This closure applies only to the origin.The framework does not define a closed system.Once the relational cause is given, all further structure, behavior, and manifestation are free to unfold, provided they remain consistent with the primary relation.RP9 therefore:
closes the cause but leaves the consequences open Material placed here may include:
alternative geometric projections extended relational matrices domain-specific applications visualizations, simulations, or models comparative mappings to other frameworks All such material is:
non-foundational optional context-dependent None of it is required for the validity of RP9.This appendix may not contain:
new axioms revisions of Axiom 0 redefinitions of relational terms modifications of the relational sheets (A–C) Any such change would constitute a different framework, not an extension.All material in this appendix carries local causal responsibility.That is:
authors are responsible for their own derivations consequences are not endorsed as necessary validity is domain-specific, not global RP9 provides the cause.
The appendix records what others do with it.This appendix is intentionally open-ended.Its existence does not imply incompleteness of the framework, but rather acknowledges that a closed cause does not imply a closed world.End of APPENDIX.Question This work is free to share, remix, and build upon,
