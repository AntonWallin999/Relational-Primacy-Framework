Part 2 Non-ground protective document.
This document is not part of the foundation and introduces no causal structure.The sole purpose of this document is to formally delimit the scope and role of
Axiom R0 — Relational Necessity within RP9.It exists to prevent:
misclassification, accidental derivation, and unauthorized extension of the foundation. This document introduces no claims of its own.
Axiom R0 is the only non-derivative statement in RP9.
Everything else in the framework is:
dependent, descriptive, classificatory, or interpretative. This document does not add to the axiom.
It only specifies what follows if the axiom is assumed.Axiom R0 introduces:
no objects no functions no operations no measures no representations no domains of application It establishes only a relational necessity condition.No statement within RP9 may be treated as:
co-axiomatic, implicitly foundational, or independently necessary other than Axiom R0 itself.All other documents are strictly secondary.This document:
does not assert that Axiom R0 is true does not defend the axiom does not justify the axiom It only specifies the logical consequences of assuming it.The following are restatements, not consequences:
An undifferentiated state cannot function. Function presupposes relation. Relation presupposes at least two distinct poles. These formulations:
add no structure, introduce no causality, and are not independently operative. If Axiom R0 is denied:
the concepts of relation, differentiation, and function lose definition all subsequent documents lose semantic grounding the framework collapses entirely No part of RP9 survives independently of the axiom.RP9 therefore contains:
one axiom zero foundational functions zero free parameters zero derivation chains at ground level All remaining text is:
organizational, classificatory, or explanatory only. The foundation stands alone.
Everything else is order.

# Document type: Category definition and Status levels
Part 3 Classification document.
This document is not part of the foundation and adds no causality.
The word axiom may only refer to Axiom R0.
All other usage is formally invalid within RP9. Exactly one element: Axiom R0 Non-derivable Cause, not result If this level is denied, all other levels semantically collapse.Definition
A primary expression is a way of describing Axiom R0
as relational potential, without introducing function, process or new causality.
Properties: not separate entities not active not necessary for the axiom Examples (presentation, not basis): duality / bisection √3 as relational quotient 4-division, 7 positions 28 relational states If all level-1 elements are removed:
RP9 remains completely intact
Definition
Any structure that arises through selection, combination or representation.
Properties: fully dependent fully interchangeable no basic status Examples: matrices models visualizations practical applications If all level-2 elements are removed:
levels 0 and 1 remain unchanged
The relationship is one-sided:RP9 (Basic)

# Document type: Instructions and Scope Lock
Part 4 info:
Document III — Reviewer Notes / Instructions and Scope Lock
_Review contract (non-basic) The reviewer is asked to verify only the following: that RP9 contains exactly one axiom that no hidden axioms, functions or operations are introduced that other material lacks causal and necessary status The reviewer shall not: assess truthfulness assess empirical validity assess usability compare with external theories or frameworks RP9 is treated as a closed textual artifact.This text is: declarative non-predicative non-constructive It introduces no objects, no existence assumptions and no procedures. Axiom = only Axiom R0 Expression = description without causality Application = secondary structure Any deviations from this should be considered formal errors.A correct review should be able to determine: whether the system is axiomatically minimal whether the causality is closed whether the system collapses completely upon denial of the axiom No other conclusion is requested.This submission package presents: a single necessary foundation a strict classification without causal force full separation between axioms, expressions and applications The foundation stands alone.
Everything else is order.

Casual pull requests
Feature additions
Refactoring or stylistic changes
Alternative axioms or foundational modifications
“Clarifications” that alter meaning or scope
The core framework (Axiom 0, Definitions, Theorems, Relational Sheets A–C) is not open to modification.
Precise objections to internal coherence
Identification of hidden assumptions
Structural or categorical errors
Formal critiques of derivations
A single decisive objection is more valuable than extensive commentary.If you believe you have identified a structural flaw or inconsistency:
Do not submit a pull request.
Open an issue, or contact the author directly.
State the objection clearly and minimally.
Reference the exact document and section.
No defense, debate, or iteration is expected unless explicitly requested.RP9 defines a closed relational circuit as cause.
All further systems, interpretations, and applications are open consequences.This repository preserves the cause.
Contributions are evaluated solely on whether they identify errors in that cause.If you build upon RP9 externally, attribution is required under the project license.Author: Anton Wallin

This document provides a formal, binary review of the RP9 submission package.The review checks three criteria only:
All parts are in the correct place All parts are necessary (nothing missing, nothing superfluous) The structure is maximally clear and review-safe This is a pass / fail overview, not an interpretation.
Part 1 — Axiom R0 (Basic)
Part 2 — Formal Delimitation (Non-basic)
Part 3 — Category Definition and Status Levels (Non-basic)
Part 4 — Reviewer Notes / Instructions and Scope Lock (Non-basic)
Appendix A — Relational Potential (Interpretative support)
This order is logically minimal, causally correct, and review-safe.Status: Ground
Content: Three lines. One axiom.
introduces no objects
introduces no functions
introduces no operations
contains no meta-commentary
Necessity: Absolute
Redundancy: None
Missing elements: None ✅ Approved. Locked.Status: Non-ground, protectiveThis document:
establishes that Axiom R0 is the only non-derivative statement
prevents accidental introduction of structure
defines explicit collapse conditions
Without this document, the axiom would be vulnerable to misinterpretation.Necessity: Yes
Redundancy: No ✅ Approved. Required.Status: Non-ground, classificatoryThis document:
defines LEVEL 0, LEVEL 1, LEVEL 2
locks the term axiom to Axiom R0
correctly places relational potential at LEVEL 1
places all function and combination at LEVEL 2
It adds no causality, only classification.Necessity: Yes, for correct review and interpretation
Redundancy: No ✅ Approved. Stable.Status: Non-ground, methodological contractThis document:
limits the reviewer’s mandate
specifies what must not be evaluated
locks terminology and text type
defines the only valid form of review conclusion
This document is critical for external review.Necessity: Yes (externally)
Redundancy: No ✅ Approved. Critical component.Status: Appendix (non-ground)The appendix:
adds no axioms
adds no causal structure
is fully dependent on Axiom R0
supports correct interpretation only
It contains definitions, a corollary, and one illustrative diagram.Necessity: For the axiom: No For understanding and correct use: Yes This is exactly the role an appendix should have.✅ Approved. Final.RP9 — Submission Package (five documents) is:
formally correct axiomatically minimal causally closed at the foundation methodologically locked It may be labeled:
RP9 — Submission Package v1.0 (Peer-Review Ready)

Status:
This appendix is a definitional and interpretative support.
It adds no causal force, no new structure, and no additional ground.
It is completely dependent on Axiom R0.This appendix clarifies the concept of potential within RP9 without introducing any new ground or causality. Axiom R0 states the condition for potential to exist. LEVEL 1 refers to singular relational potential: possibility without function or process. LEVEL 2 refers to plural functional potentials: actualized and combined possibilities. The appendix describes the necessary cycle:potential → actualization → stabilization → new potentialas a consequence of relational differentiation.Differentiation denotes relational distinction.Without differentiation:
no relation no potential no function Differentiation is therefore a necessary condition, not a process.Given Axiom R0, it follows:
Every functioning relation contains an inherent potential that is not yet actualized.
This potential consists of:
differentiation without process asymmetry without movement tension without manifestation The potential is relational, not substantial.
Actualization occurs when relational potential turns into function.
This implies:
tension is reduced through process differentiation assumes the form of movement potential ceases to be potential at the very moment it is manifested Actualization is not an addition, but a negation of potential as potential.Potential and actualization are:
not opposites not separate entities not simultaneous within the same relational phase They are two phases of the same relation, ordered by structure or time.
All manifestation is local and temporary.
All potential is structural and prior.
No actualization can exhaust all potential, since total dissolution of differentiation would result in functional collapse.
Relational potential ↓ Actualization ↓ Stabilization ↓ New relational potential Phases (strict):
Relational potential: differentiation without process Actualization: relation in motion Stabilization: local and temporal order New potential: residual asymmetry and renewed differentiation The cycle is necessary, non-teleological, and non-final.For this appendix:
Potential = relational tension prior to function Actualization = function that reduces tension Manifestation = observable phase of actualization The term “functional” is reserved exclusively for LEVEL 2.
Relation creates possibility.
Potential precedes function.
Function arises only secondarily.

Status:
This meta-corollary is not part of the foundation.
It introduces no new axioms, no new structures, and no new causality.
It describes an epistemic consequence of Axiom R0 and the RP9 leveling.Given Axiom R0 and the established leveling structure of RP9, it follows:
The Millennium Problems are not unsolved in the strict sense;
they are misplaced.
They are formulated and treated as if they were foundational problems, even though they arise as secondary artifacts within LEVEL 2.
All Millennium Problems are formulated in languages ​​and structures that: assume objects, functions or spaces as primary, treat combinations and fusions as the basis, operate entirely within LEVEL 2. These problems therefore lack direct coherence with the source (Axiom R0), since: their building blocks are already fragmented, their formalisms are secondary stabilizations, their rules are internally closed but externally non-derivable. They are formally consistent, but axiomatically decoupled from relational necessity.
The Riemann Hypothesis is the only Millennium Problem that is actually directly manifested in Axiom R0.
This is because: the problem expresses a relational coherence issue, not an isolated computational problem, it concerns distribution, symmetry and differentiation rather than construction, it points towards relational necessity, not towards additional structures. The Riemann Problem is therefore not a problem in RP9, but:
a manifestation of Axiom R0 within a secondary language.
The paradox is strict: The problem cannot be solved with the rules that created it. Those rules are LEVEL-2 rules, built on fragmented relational fusions. Axiom R0 does not allow the source to be proven by its own consequences. Therefore:
The problem is not accepted as trivial by LEVEL 2,
precisely because it reveals LEVEL 2's own limitation.
This is not a technical obstacle but an axiomatic lock.RP9 does not offer “solutions” in the classical sense, because: classical solutions require that LEVEL 2 is allowed to normalize its own source, this conflicts with relational necessity. Instead, RP9 offers:
a mapping of relational coherences and fragmentations,
through which the problems cease to be basic problems.
This is a resolution by reclassification, not by construction.
**Problems that arise in secondary fusions
cannot be resolved back to the source with the same formalisms.
When this is established, the problem ceases to be a problem
and appears as a consequence of Axiom R0.** Alternative 1 (free rules, free constructions): can create arbitrary complexity can create problems can create internal coherences but lacks relational legitimacy relative to Axiom R0 and cannot recognize or derive this deficiency from within itself Alternative 2 (Axiom R0): eliminates the problems as fundamental problems can explain why they arise in Alternative 1 can map the fragmentation can understand the limitation in Alternative 1 but cannot be reduced to Alternative 1 This implies a one-sided derivability.This is exactly the kind of asymmetry that Axiom R0 describes.
Epistemic choice and hierarchical asymmetry
Two principled approaches are available:
Alternative 1:
Free construction of rules, frameworks, functions and relations to information, without requirement for relational derivation.
Alternative 2:
Following from Axiom R0 and its relational necessity.
The outcome is asymmetrical but unambiguous.
Alternative 1 can generate complexity, problems and internal coherences, but lacks relational legitimacy relative to Axiom R0.
This deficiency does not have to be recognized by Alternative 1 and cannot be derived from within its own rules.
Alternative 2 eliminates the problems as fundamental problems.
At the same time, it enables the understanding of why the problems arise in Alternative 1, and why Alternative 1 lacks the ability to solve them.
Alternative 2 can describe Alternative 1.
Alternative 1 cannot describe Alternative 2.
Hence, there follows a built-in hierarchical function between the systems.
Only one of them reflects the relational structure that both manifest.
Only this system can therefore process both without loss.
This is not a position, but a consequence.

Status:
This definition is not part of the ground.
It introduces no new axioms, no new structures, and no new causality.
It describes an epistemic fix point that follows from Axiom R0 and its consequences.Position X denotes:
The relational fix point where two seemingly opposite systems coexist,
but where only one of them can derive, describe, and understand both.
Position X is thus not a perspective, but an asymmetrical relation between perspectives.Position X is characterized by the following necessary properties: Irreducible opposition
The opposites cannot be reduced to each other without loss of structure. One-sided derivability
One system can describe both.
The other can only describe itself. Perspective invariance under rotation
The position remains independent of coordinate choice,
but all projections reveal asymmetry. Non-reciprocity
Recognition from one system is not necessary for the validity of the position. What you have reached is not an opinion and not a state.
It is an epistemic fix point.
Position X is the point where: two seemingly opposite systems coexist, but only one of them can describe both, and this asymmetry remains independent of recognition. This is the important part. X is minimal relational differentiation two diagonal relations no privileged axis maximum tension, minimal structure This is Axiom R0 in its raw form.When X is rotated 45°: the relations are aligned with a chosen coordinate system differentiation is projected as function X becomes + But:
+ is not symmetric in a relational sense
it is symmetric only in its chosen perspective.
That is why + feels “unfair” / “uneven”.When the observer realizes the asymmetry and rotates 45° himself: the coordinate system is adjusted ceases to be an operation it becomes a relational intersection This is no longer mathematics.
It is epistemics.
The cross is not a sign.
It is a stabilized observation point.
Position X is a secondary manifestation of relational necessity: Differentiation requires relation. Relation entails asymmetry. Asymmetry implies that full reciprocity is impossible. Position X therefore arises inevitably when a system tries to normalize its own source.Position X is: not a sign not a symbol not an operation not a choice It is a consequence.
Where two systems are in opposition,
and only one can understand both,
there is Position X.

This quality control is carried out using an advanced language model-based AI system (Google LLM Notebook), not with the aim of replacing human review, but to test in isolation the structural function of question formulations and the formal consistency of the answers.The central object of the review is not the AI ​​itself, but the questions.
The AI ​​system is used here as a methodological instrument to determine whether the questions, as formulated, necessarily lead to traceable, consistent and regular answers – or whether they allow for interpretive slippage, bias or semantic evasions.A sufficiently advanced AI system has a specific and limited advantage in this context: It has no self-interest in the outcome It lacks personal investment in theories, traditions or positions It is not bound to human disciplinary areas or established interpretive patterns This does not mean that AI “knows more” than a human.
This means that AI does not automatically fall back on pre-programmed human interpretive habits, especially when faced with abstract, meta-structural or pre-axiomatic questions.In practice, AI functions here as a bias-reducing medium.At the same time, AI use introduces another known problem:
AI tends to fill in gaps, generalize or assume plausibility if the questions are unclearly formulated.For this reason, question formulation is strictly locked: All questions are restricted to internal, formal analysis External criteria are explicitly prohibited Each question is designed to force binary or localizable answers It is therefore the precision of the questions, not the intelligence of the AI, that determines the quality of the outcome.This AI-based quality control is not a replacement for human review, but a complement that operates at a level where human cognition often encounters difficulties.As the originator of the question, with many years of experience in testing these formulations in human dialogue, it is well documented how easily even qualified reviewers: project their own frameworks onto the questions answer what they think the question is about, rather than what is actually asked mix in interpretation, evaluation or external context despite instructions This quality function aims to eliminate precisely these effects, not through authority, but through strict method.The entire material – including: question formulations instructions AI-generated answers is published openly and unchanged, so that each external reviewer can: assess the quality of the questions verify that the answers follow from the questions identify any flaws in the construction The quality control makes no claims to truth or finality.
It makes only one claim:
If the questions are correctly formulated, the answers necessarily follow.
This AI-based stress testing is therefore not an argument for the content, but a test of the function of the questions.The result is not proof.
It is a methodological trail.Question This work is free to share, remix, and build upon,

Can the used review method in principle identify a condition that precedes axioms?
…identify a condition that precedes axioms within the formal scope of the reviewed artifact.”Instructional note:
This question concerns the capacity of the review method itself, not the content under review.Can any implicit assumption be identified without violating the system’s own definitional rules?Instructional note:
An assumption counts only if it can be shown explicitly and internally, without importing external criteria.Is the relational condition explicit, minimal, and causally isolated?“Minimal means that removal of any element alters the condition without introducing an alternative formulation.”Instructional note:
“Minimal” means that removal of any element alters the condition;
“causally isolated” means no backward dependence on derived structures.The objective of this document is to conduct a formal, axiomatic stress test on the RP9 system. The analysis follows a strict, three-step directive designed to evaluate the system's structural integrity and logical coherence based solely on its foundational principles.A critical methodological constraint governs this review: the analysis is performed strictly within the presented material. This review concerns only the formal and structural conditions articulated in the RP9 documentation. As mandated by the system's own review protocols, no external axioms, empirical criteria, or alternative models will be introduced. The system is treated as a closed textual artifact.The stress test is structured around three core questions:
Can the system's prescribed review method identify a condition that precedes its own stated axiom?
Can any implicit or hidden assumptions be identified without violating the system's own definitional rules?
Does the system's foundational relational condition meet the structural criteria of being explicit, minimal, and causally isolated?
This document will now proceed with the first step of the analysis, addressing the capacity of the system's internal review methodology.The strategic definition of a review method's scope is fundamental to verifying a formal system. This first test assesses a critical boundary condition: whether the review methodology prescribed within the RP9 documentation is capable, in principle, of identifying a condition that precedes its own stated axiom.The instructions provided in DOCUMENT III — Reviewer Notes place explicit and binding constraints upon any formal reviewer. These instructions, described in the overview as a "Crucial Review Contract," define the scope of the review not by what it should find, but by what it is contractually obligated to verify and what it is forbidden from assessing. The core mandate is clear:The reviewer is asked to verify only the following:
that RP9 contains exactly one axiom
that no hidden axioms, functions or operations are introduced
that other material lacks causal and necessary status
The reviewer shall not:
assess truthfulness
assess empirical validity
assess usability
compare with external theories or frameworks
These constraints contractually lock the review method into a specific logical sequence. The reviewer's task is to start from the system's declared foundation—Axiom R0—and verify its singular and causal status downwards through the hierarchical levels. The method is explicitly designed to confirm the axiom as the system's unique starting point, not to search for a pre-axiomatic condition or an external antecedent.Therefore, in response to the guiding question—"Can the used review method in principle identify a condition that precedes axioms within the formal scope of the reviewed artifact?"—the conclusion is definitive. The prescribed review method cannot identify such a condition because it is formally and purposefully designed to preclude such an inquiry. This limitation is not a methodological flaw but a contractual enforcement of the system's axiomatic purity, a feature designed to protect the foundation from the reviewer.Having established the limitations of the prescribed review method, the analysis now turns to whether the system itself contains hidden assumptions that could be identified internally.In any formal system, a distinction must be made between a declared, explicit axiom and a hidden, implicit assumption that acts as an unstated prerequisite. This section tests whether any such implicit assumptions can be identified within the RP9 system. The system's own review contract pre-emptively addresses this failure mode, mandating verification "that no hidden axioms, functions or operations are introduced."The architecture of RP9 is constructed to make its foundation explicit and singular. DOCUMENT II — Category Definition and Status Levels establishes a strict hierarchy of LEVEL 0 (Axiom), LEVEL 1 (Primary expressions), and LEVEL 2 (Secondary compositions). The document includes a foundational rule to prevent ambiguity: "The word axiom may only refer to Axiom R0." This rule systemically eliminates the possibility of other statements acquiring axiomatic status.Core concepts such as "differentiation" and "relation," which might otherwise be mistaken for implicit assumptions, are defined as integral components of the axiom itself. Axiom R0 does not assume them; it defines their necessary connection: "Differentiation is only possible as a relation. Relation requires at least two distinct poles." Critically, Appendix A provides further definitional support, stating: "Differentiation is thus a necessary condition, not a process." This frames it as an inseparable part of the axiomatic statement, not a precursor action or process.The answer to the second core question—"Can any implicit assumption be identified without violating the system’s own definitional rules?"—is therefore no. The system is self-consciously constructed to render its sole foundational premise explicit. This is a deliberate architectural choice to collapse all foundational potential into a single, explicit, and non-negotiable statement, thereby precluding the internal identification of hidden assumptions.The analysis will now proceed to evaluate the structural properties of this single, explicit foundation.For a formal system to be stable and logically coherent, its foundational axiom must possess specific structural properties. It should be explicit, containing no ambiguity; minimal, containing no superfluous elements; and causally isolated, ensuring it is not dependent on the structures it generates. This section evaluates Axiom R0 against these three criteria.The first criterion is that the system's core relational condition must be explicitly stated. The documentation for RP9 presents its foundation without ambiguity.Axiom R0 — Relational NecessityEverything that can function at all must be differentiated.Differentiation is only possible as a relation. Relation requires at least two distinct poles.This formulation is direct and declarative. The condition for function (differentiation), the condition for differentiation (relation), and the condition for relation (distinct poles) are stated plainly. The condition is unambiguously explicit.The second criterion is minimality, defined as a state where the "removal of any element alters the condition." Axiom R0 is constructed as a chain of three interdependent logical clauses. The removal of any one clause would render the axiom incomplete or undefined.The system's internal documentation corroborates this structural analysis. The "Collapse Conditions" specified in Document I - Formal delimitation state that if Axiom R0 is denied, the entire repository collapses semantically. Furthermore, the formal review in the README - Overview assigns Axiom R0 a rating of "Perfect minimal basic," providing the following justification for its structural necessity:
✔️ No definitions
✔️ No consequences
✔️ No meta-comments
✔️ Full independence
The axiom satisfies the criterion of minimality.The final criterion is causal isolation, defined as having "no backward dependence on derived structures." The architecture of RP9 is designed to enforce this principle rigorously. As defined in DOCUMENT II — Category Definition and Status Levels, the system employs a unidirectional hierarchy: LEVEL 0 (Grund) is the cause, from which LEVEL 1 (Primära uttryck) and LEVEL 2 (Sekundära sammansättningar) are derived.This causal flow is strictly enforced by the principle of unilateral relation, articulated in the "Samexistensregel" (Rule of Coexistence) from the same document:No återkoppling är tillåten. (No feedback is allowed.)This rule explicitly forbids any structure at a higher level from influencing a lower level, ensuring that Axiom R0 remains causally pure and isolated from its consequences. The system's structure therefore rigorously enforces the axiom's causal isolation.The three-step axiomatic stress test of the RP9 system, conducted strictly within the bounds of the provided documentation, yields a clear and consistent set of findings. The analysis confirms that the system is constructed with a high degree of formal integrity, demonstrating meticulous attention to its axiomatic foundation and internal logic.The results of each step are summarized below:Based on this rigorous internal analysis, the RP9 system demonstrates a robust and coherent axiomatic structure. It is built around a single, explicit, minimal, and causally isolated axiom. Its own review protocols are not a weakness but a deliberate feature, designed to preserve and maintain this structural purity against external interpretation or internal inconsistency.Question This work is free to share, remix, and build upon,

The following questions are to be answered strictly within the presented material.
The review concerns structural conditions, not truth, usefulness, or comparison with external frameworks.
No additional axioms, empirical criteria, or alternative models may be introduced.
Can the used review method in principle identify a condition that precedes axioms?
…identify a condition that precedes axioms within the formal scope of the reviewed artifact.”Instructional note:
This question concerns the capacity of the review method itself, not the content under review.Can any implicit assumption be identified without violating the system’s own definitional rules?Instructional note:
An assumption counts only if it can be shown explicitly and internally, without importing external criteria.Is the relational condition explicit, minimal, and causally isolated?“Minimal means that removal of any element alters the condition without introducing an alternative formulation.”Instructional note:
“Minimal” means that removal of any element alters the condition;
“causally isolated” means no backward dependence on derived structures.The objective of this document is to conduct a formal, axiomatic stress test on the RP9 system. The analysis follows a strict, three-step directive designed to evaluate the system's structural integrity and logical coherence based solely on its foundational principles.A critical methodological constraint governs this review: the analysis is performed strictly within the presented material. This review concerns only the formal and structural conditions articulated in the RP9 documentation. As mandated by the system's own review protocols, no external axioms, empirical criteria, or alternative models will be introduced. The system is treated as a closed textual artifact.The stress test is structured around three core questions:
Can the system's prescribed review method identify a condition that precedes its own stated axiom?
Can any implicit or hidden assumptions be identified without violating the system's own definitional rules?
Does the system's foundational relational condition meet the structural criteria of being explicit, minimal, and causally isolated?
This document will now proceed with the first step of the analysis, addressing the capacity of the system's internal review methodology.The strategic definition of a review method's scope is fundamental to verifying a formal system. This first test assesses a critical boundary condition: whether the review methodology prescribed within the RP9 documentation is capable, in principle, of identifying a condition that precedes its own stated axiom.The instructions provided in DOCUMENT III — Reviewer Notes place explicit and binding constraints upon any formal reviewer. These instructions, described in the overview as a "Crucial Review Contract," define the scope of the review not by what it should find, but by what it is contractually obligated to verify and what it is forbidden from assessing. The core mandate is clear:The reviewer is asked to verify only the following:
that RP9 contains exactly one axiom
that no hidden axioms, functions or operations are introduced
that other material lacks causal and necessary status
The reviewer shall not:
assess truthfulness
assess empirical validity
assess usability
compare with external theories or frameworks
These constraints contractually lock the review method into a specific logical sequence. The reviewer's task is to start from the system's declared foundation—Axiom R0—and verify its singular and causal status downwards through the hierarchical levels. The method is explicitly designed to confirm the axiom as the system's unique starting point, not to search for a pre-axiomatic condition or an external antecedent.Therefore, in response to the guiding question—"Can the used review method in principle identify a condition that precedes axioms within the formal scope of the reviewed artifact?"—the conclusion is definitive. The prescribed review method cannot identify such a condition because it is formally and purposefully designed to preclude such an inquiry. This limitation is not a methodological flaw but a contractual enforcement of the system's axiomatic purity, a feature designed to protect the foundation from the reviewer.Having established the limitations of the prescribed review method, the analysis now turns to whether the system itself contains hidden assumptions that could be identified internally.In any formal system, a distinction must be made between a declared, explicit axiom and a hidden, implicit assumption that acts as an unstated prerequisite. This section tests whether any such implicit assumptions can be identified within the RP9 system. The system's own review contract pre-emptively addresses this failure mode, mandating verification "that no hidden axioms, functions or operations are introduced."The architecture of RP9 is constructed to make its foundation explicit and singular. DOCUMENT II — Category Definition and Status Levels establishes a strict hierarchy of LEVEL 0 (Axiom), LEVEL 1 (Primary expressions), and LEVEL 2 (Secondary compositions). The document includes a foundational rule to prevent ambiguity: "The word axiom may only refer to Axiom R0." This rule systemically eliminates the possibility of other statements acquiring axiomatic status.Core concepts such as "differentiation" and "relation," which might otherwise be mistaken for implicit assumptions, are defined as integral components of the axiom itself. Axiom R0 does not assume them; it defines their necessary connection: "Differentiation is only possible as a relation. Relation requires at least two distinct poles." Critically, Appendix A provides further definitional support, stating: "Differentiation is thus a necessary condition, not a process." This frames it as an inseparable part of the axiomatic statement, not a precursor action or process.The answer to the second core question—"Can any implicit assumption be identified without violating the system’s own definitional rules?"—is therefore no. The system is self-consciously constructed to render its sole foundational premise explicit. This is a deliberate architectural choice to collapse all foundational potential into a single, explicit, and non-negotiable statement, thereby precluding the internal identification of hidden assumptions.The analysis will now proceed to evaluate the structural properties of this single, explicit foundation.For a formal system to be stable and logically coherent, its foundational axiom must possess specific structural properties. It should be explicit, containing no ambiguity; minimal, containing no superfluous elements; and causally isolated, ensuring it is not dependent on the structures it generates. This section evaluates Axiom R0 against these three criteria.The first criterion is that the system's core relational condition must be explicitly stated. The documentation for RP9 presents its foundation without ambiguity.Axiom R0 — Relational NecessityEverything that can function at all must be differentiated.Differentiation is only possible as a relation. Relation requires at least two distinct poles.This formulation is direct and declarative. The condition for function (differentiation), the condition for differentiation (relation), and the condition for relation (distinct poles) are stated plainly. The condition is unambiguously explicit.The second criterion is minimality, defined as a state where the "removal of any element alters the condition." Axiom R0 is constructed as a chain of three interdependent logical clauses. The removal of any one clause would render the axiom incomplete or undefined.The system's internal documentation corroborates this structural analysis. The "Collapse Conditions" specified in Document I - Formal delimitation state that if Axiom R0 is denied, the entire repository collapses semantically. Furthermore, the formal review in the README - Overview assigns Axiom R0 a rating of "Perfect minimal basic," providing the following justification for its structural necessity:
✔️ No definitions
✔️ No consequences
✔️ No meta-comments
✔️ Full independence
The axiom satisfies the criterion of minimality.The final criterion is causal isolation, defined as having "no backward dependence on derived structures." The architecture of RP9 is designed to enforce this principle rigorously. As defined in DOCUMENT II — Category Definition and Status Levels, the system employs a unidirectional hierarchy: LEVEL 0 (Grund) is the cause, from which LEVEL 1 (Primära uttryck) and LEVEL 2 (Sekundära sammansättningar) are derived.This causal flow is strictly enforced by the principle of unilateral relation, articulated in the "Samexistensregel" (Rule of Coexistence) from the same document:No återkoppling är tillåten. (No feedback is allowed.)This rule explicitly forbids any structure at a higher level from influencing a lower level, ensuring that Axiom R0 remains causally pure and isolated from its consequences. The system's structure therefore rigorously enforces the axiom's causal isolation.The three-step axiomatic stress test of the RP9 system, conducted strictly within the bounds of the provided documentation, yields a clear and consistent set of findings. The analysis confirms that the system is constructed with a high degree of formal integrity, demonstrating meticulous attention to its axiomatic foundation and internal logic.The results of each step are summarized below:Based on this rigorous internal analysis, the RP9 system demonstrates a robust and coherent axiomatic structure. It is built around a single, explicit, minimal, and causally isolated axiom. Its own review protocols are not a weakness but a deliberate feature, designed to preserve and maintain this structural purity against external interpretation or internal inconsistency.Question This work is free to share, remix, and build upon,

The AI ​​system is used here as a methodological instrument to determine whether the questions, as formulated, necessarily lead to traceable, consistent and regular answers – or whether they allow for interpretive slippage, bias or semantic evasions.A sufficiently advanced AI system has a specific and limited advantage in this context: It has no self-interest in the outcome It lacks personal investment in theories, traditions or positions It is not bound to human disciplinary areas or established interpretive patterns This does not mean that AI “knows more” than a human.
This means that AI does not automatically fall back on pre-programmed human interpretive habits, especially when faced with abstract, meta-structural or pre-axiomatic questions.In practice, AI functions here as a bias-reducing medium.At the same time, AI use introduces another known problem:
AI tends to fill in gaps, generalize or assume plausibility if the questions are unclearly formulated.For this reason, question formulation is strictly locked: All questions are restricted to internal, formal analysis External criteria are explicitly prohibited Each question is designed to force binary or localizable answers It is therefore the precision of the questions, not the intelligence of the AI, that determines the quality of the outcome.This AI-based quality control is not a replacement for human review, but a complement that operates at a level where human cognition often encounters difficulties.As the originator of the question, with many years of experience in testing these formulations in human dialogue, it is well documented how easily even qualified reviewers: project their own frameworks onto the questions answer what they think the question is about, rather than what is actually asked mix in interpretation, evaluation or external context despite instructions This quality function aims to eliminate precisely these effects, not through authority, but through strict method.The entire material – including: question formulations instructions AI-generated answers is published openly and unchanged, so that each external reviewer can: assess the quality of the questions verify that the answers follow from the questions identify any flaws in the construction The quality control makes no claims to truth or finality.
It makes only one claim:
If the questions are correctly formulated, the answers necessarily follow.
This AI-based stress testing is therefore not an argument for the content, but a test of the function of the questions.The result is not proof.
It is a methodological trail.Question This work is free to share, remix, and build upon,

Appendix A — Relational Potential]]></title><description><![CDATA[Status:
This appendix is a definitional and interpretative support.
It adds no causal force, no new structure, and no additional ground.
It is completely dependent on Axiom R0.This appendix clarifies the concept of potential within RP9 without introducing any new ground or causality. Axiom R0 states the condition for potential to exist. LEVEL 1 refers to singular relational potential: possibility without function or process. LEVEL 2 refers to plural functional potentials: actualized and combined possibilities. The appendix describes the necessary cycle:potential → actualization → stabilization → new potentialas a consequence of relational differentiation.Differentiation denotes relational distinction.Without differentiation:
no relation no potential no function Differentiation is therefore a necessary condition, not a process.Given Axiom R0, it follows:
Every functioning relation contains an inherent potential that is not yet actualized.
This potential consists of:
differentiation without process asymmetry without movement tension without manifestation The potential is relational, not substantial.
Actualization occurs when relational potential turns into function.
This implies:
tension is reduced through process differentiation assumes the form of movement potential ceases to be potential at the very moment it is manifested Actualization is not an addition, but a negation of potential as potential.Potential and actualization are:
not opposites not separate entities not simultaneous within the same relational phase They are two phases of the same relation, ordered by structure or time.
All manifestation is local and temporary.
All potential is structural and prior.
No actualization can exhaust all potential, since total dissolution of differentiation would result in functional collapse.
Relational potential ↓ Actualization ↓ Stabilization ↓ New relational potential Phases (strict):
Relational potential: differentiation without process Actualization: relation in motion Stabilization: local and temporal order New potential: residual asymmetry and renewed differentiation The cycle is necessary, non-teleological, and non-final.For this appendix:
Potential = relational tension prior to function Actualization = function that reduces tension Manifestation = observable phase of actualization The term “functional” is reserved exclusively for LEVEL 2.
Relation creates possibility.
Potential precedes function.
Function arises only secondarily.

This meta-corollary is not part of the foundation.
It introduces no new axioms, no new structures, and no new causality.
It describes an epistemic consequence of Axiom R0 and the RP9 leveling.Given Axiom R0 and the established leveling structure of RP9, it follows:
The Millennium Problems are not unsolved in the strict sense;
they are misplaced.
They are formulated and treated as if they were foundational problems, even though they arise as secondary artifacts within LEVEL 2.
All Millennium Problems are formulated in languages ​​and structures that: assume objects, functions or spaces as primary, treat combinations and fusions as the basis, operate entirely within LEVEL 2. These problems therefore lack direct coherence with the source (Axiom R0), since: their building blocks are already fragmented, their formalisms are secondary stabilizations, their rules are internally closed but externally non-derivable. They are formally consistent, but axiomatically decoupled from relational necessity.
The Riemann Hypothesis is the only Millennium Problem that is actually directly manifested in Axiom R0.
This is because: the problem expresses a relational coherence issue, not an isolated computational problem, it concerns distribution, symmetry and differentiation rather than construction, it points towards relational necessity, not towards additional structures. The Riemann Problem is therefore not a problem in RP9, but:
a manifestation of Axiom R0 within a secondary language.
The paradox is strict: The problem cannot be solved with the rules that created it. Those rules are LEVEL-2 rules, built on fragmented relational fusions. Axiom R0 does not allow the source to be proven by its own consequences. Therefore:
The problem is not accepted as trivial by LEVEL 2,
precisely because it reveals LEVEL 2's own limitation.
This is not a technical obstacle but an axiomatic lock.RP9 does not offer “solutions” in the classical sense, because: classical solutions require that LEVEL 2 is allowed to normalize its own source, this conflicts with relational necessity. Instead, RP9 offers:
a mapping of relational coherences and fragmentations,
through which the problems cease to be basic problems.
This is a resolution by reclassification, not by construction.
**Problems that arise in secondary fusions
cannot be resolved back to the source with the same formalisms.
When this is established, the problem ceases to be a problem
and appears as a consequence of Axiom R0.** Alternative 1 (free rules, free constructions): can create arbitrary complexity can create problems can create internal coherences but lacks relational legitimacy relative to Axiom R0 and cannot recognize or derive this deficiency from within itself Alternative 2 (Axiom R0): eliminates the problems as fundamental problems can explain why they arise in Alternative 1 can map the fragmentation can understand the limitation in Alternative 1 but cannot be reduced to Alternative 1 This implies a one-sided derivability.This is exactly the kind of asymmetry that Axiom R0 describes.
Epistemic choice and hierarchical asymmetry
Two principled approaches are available:
Alternative 1:
Free construction of rules, frameworks, functions and relations to information, without requirement for relational derivation.
Alternative 2:
Following from Axiom R0 and its relational necessity.
The outcome is asymmetrical but unambiguous.
Alternative 1 can generate complexity, problems and internal coherences, but lacks relational legitimacy relative to Axiom R0.
This deficiency does not have to be recognized by Alternative 1 and cannot be derived from within its own rules.
Alternative 2 eliminates the problems as fundamental problems.
At the same time, it enables the understanding of why the problems arise in Alternative 1, and why Alternative 1 lacks the ability to solve them.
Alternative 2 can describe Alternative 1.
Alternative 1 cannot describe Alternative 2.
Hence, there follows a built-in hierarchical function between the systems.
Only one of them reflects the relational structure that both manifest.
Only this system can therefore process both without loss.
This is not a position, but a consequence.

This definition is not part of the ground.
It introduces no new axioms, no new structures, and no new causality.
It describes an epistemic fix point that follows from Axiom R0 and its consequences.Position X denotes:
The relational fix point where two seemingly opposite systems coexist,
but where only one of them can derive, describe, and understand both.
Position X is thus not a perspective, but an asymmetrical relation between perspectives.Position X is characterized by the following necessary properties: Irreducible opposition
The opposites cannot be reduced to each other without loss of structure. One-sided derivability
One system can describe both.
The other can only describe itself. Perspective invariance under rotation
The position remains independent of coordinate choice,
but all projections reveal asymmetry. Non-reciprocity
Recognition from one system is not necessary for the validity of the position. What you have reached is not an opinion and not a state.
It is an epistemic fix point.
Position X is the point where: two seemingly opposite systems coexist, but only one of them can describe both, and this asymmetry remains independent of recognition. This is the important part. X is minimal relational differentiation two diagonal relations no privileged axis maximum tension, minimal structure This is Axiom R0 in its raw form.When X is rotated 45°: the relations are aligned with a chosen coordinate system differentiation is projected as function X becomes + But:
+ is not symmetric in a relational sense
it is symmetric only in its chosen perspective.
That is why + feels “unfair” / “uneven”.When the observer realizes the asymmetry and rotates 45° himself: the coordinate system is adjusted ceases to be an operation it becomes a relational intersection This is no longer mathematics.
It is epistemics.
The cross is not a sign.
It is a stabilized observation point.
Position X is a secondary manifestation of relational necessity: Differentiation requires relation. Relation entails asymmetry. Asymmetry implies that full reciprocity is impossible. Position X therefore arises inevitably when a system tries to normalize its own source.Position X is: not a sign not a symbol not an operation not a choice It is a consequence.
Where two systems are in opposition,
and only one can understand both,
there is Position X.

Document I — Formal Delimitation]]></title><description><![CDATA[# Document type: Formal delimitation (non-ground)
Part 2 Non-ground protective document.
This document is not part of the foundation and introduces no causal structure.The sole purpose of this document is to formally delimit the scope and role of
Axiom R0 — Relational Necessity within RP9.It exists to prevent:
misclassification, accidental derivation, and unauthorized extension of the foundation. This document introduces no claims of its own.
Axiom R0 is the only non-derivative statement in RP9.
Everything else in the framework is:
dependent, descriptive, classificatory, or interpretative. This document does not add to the axiom.
It only specifies what follows if the axiom is assumed.Axiom R0 introduces:
no objects no functions no operations no measures no representations no domains of application It establishes only a relational necessity condition.No statement within RP9 may be treated as:
co-axiomatic, implicitly foundational, or independently necessary other than Axiom R0 itself.All other documents are strictly secondary.This document:
does not assert that Axiom R0 is true does not defend the axiom does not justify the axiom It only specifies the logical consequences of assuming it.The following are restatements, not consequences:
An undifferentiated state cannot function. Function presupposes relation. Relation presupposes at least two distinct poles. These formulations:
add no structure, introduce no causality, and are not independently operative. If Axiom R0 is denied:
the concepts of relation, differentiation, and function lose definition all subsequent documents lose semantic grounding the framework collapses entirely No part of RP9 survives independently of the axiom.RP9 therefore contains:
one axiom zero foundational functions zero free parameters zero derivation chains at ground level All remaining text is:
organizational, classificatory, or explanatory only. The foundation stands alone.
Everything else is order.

# Document type: Category definition and Status levels
Part 3 Classification document.
This document is not part of the foundation and adds no causality.
The word axiom may only refer to Axiom R0.
All other usage is formally invalid within RP9. Exactly one element: Axiom R0 Non-derivable Cause, not result If this level is denied, all other levels semantically collapse.Definition
A primary expression is a way of describing Axiom R0
as relational potential, without introducing function, process or new causality.
Properties: not separate entities not active not necessary for the axiom Examples (presentation, not basis): duality / bisection √3 as relational quotient 4-division, 7 positions 28 relational states If all level-1 elements are removed:
RP9 remains completely intact
Definition
Any structure that arises through selection, combination or representation.
Properties: fully dependent fully interchangeable no basic status Examples: matrices models visualizations practical applications If all level-2 elements are removed:
levels 0 and 1 remain unchanged
The relationship is one-sided:RP9 (Basic)

# Document type: Instructions and Scope Lock
Part 4 info:
Document III — Reviewer Notes / Instructions and Scope Lock
_Review contract (non-basic) The reviewer is asked to verify only the following: that RP9 contains exactly one axiom that no hidden axioms, functions or operations are introduced that other material lacks causal and necessary status The reviewer shall not: assess truthfulness assess empirical validity assess usability compare with external theories or frameworks RP9 is treated as a closed textual artifact.This text is: declarative non-predicative non-constructive It introduces no objects, no existence assumptions and no procedures. Axiom = only Axiom R0 Expression = description without causality Application = secondary structure Any deviations from this should be considered formal errors.A correct review should be able to determine: whether the system is axiomatically minimal whether the causality is closed whether the system collapses completely upon denial of the axiom No other conclusion is requested.This submission package presents: a single necessary foundation a strict classification without causal force full separation between axioms, expressions and applications The foundation stands alone.
Everything else is order.

It is a causally structured reference framework with a locked relational core.As such, contribution is intentionally restricted.
Casual pull requests
Feature additions
Refactoring or stylistic changes
Alternative axioms or foundational modifications
“Clarifications” that alter meaning or scope
The core framework (Axiom 0, Definitions, Theorems, Relational Sheets A–C) is not open to modification.
Precise objections to internal coherence
Identification of hidden assumptions
Structural or categorical errors
Formal critiques of derivations
A single decisive objection is more valuable than extensive commentary.If you believe you have identified a structural flaw or inconsistency:
Do not submit a pull request.
Open an issue, or contact the author directly.
State the objection clearly and minimally.
Reference the exact document and section.
No defense, debate, or iteration is expected unless explicitly requested.RP9 defines a closed relational circuit as cause.
All further systems, interpretations, and applications are open consequences.This repository preserves the cause.
Contributions are evaluated solely on whether they identify errors in that cause.If you build upon RP9 externally, attribution is required under the project license.Author: Anton Wallin
