# Contributing to RP9 — Relational Primacy Framework

Thank you for your interest in RP9.

This repository is **not a conventional open-source project**.  
It is a **causally structured reference framework** with a locked relational core.

As such, contribution is intentionally restricted.

---

## Scope of contributions

### ❌ Not accepted

- Casual pull requests
- Feature additions
- Refactoring or stylistic changes
- Alternative axioms or foundational modifications
- “Clarifications” that alter meaning or scope

The core framework (Axiom 0, Definitions, Theorems, Relational Sheets A–C) is **not open to modification**.

---

### ✅ Accepted (by request only)

- Precise objections to internal coherence
- Identification of hidden assumptions
- Structural or categorical errors
- Formal critiques of derivations

A **single decisive objection** is more valuable than extensive commentary.

---

## How to engage

If you believe you have identified a structural flaw or inconsistency:

1. Do **not** submit a pull request.
2. Open an issue, or contact the author directly.
3. State the objection clearly and minimally.
4. Reference the exact document and section.

No defense, debate, or iteration is expected unless explicitly requested.

---

## Philosophy

RP9 defines a **closed relational circuit** as cause.  
All further systems, interpretations, and applications are **open consequences**.

This repository preserves the cause.  
Contributions are evaluated solely on whether they identify errors in that cause.

---

## Attribution

If you build upon RP9 externally, attribution is required under the project license.
